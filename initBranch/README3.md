# Initially branched, mutation-less game details

The game can be called as previously stated in "mainGame" folder with a few changes. The parameter file is slightly different, allowing the user to specify the initial neighborhood size and production of both subpopulations. 
The same shell and matlab file can be used for analyzing both games. 

# Transition Matrix
The transition matrix file (transitionMatrix.py) allows the user to predict the expected number of generations to subpopulation extinction for a given population size and defector equilibrium frequency. 

The game and transition matrix results can be compared, as we do in figure 3C.
