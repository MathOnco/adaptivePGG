# adaptivePGG
C++ code developed to study the emergence of dimorphic populations in nonlinear public good games (PGG).

Within the "mainGame" folder, files and instructions for running the PGG are available. 

The "initBranch" folder provides files to allow the game to proceed in a slightly different manner. Instead of seeding a monomorphic population, we seed two subpopulations (cooperators and defectors), and prohibit mutation. Then, it becomes possible to make predictions on the expected number of generations until extinction of a subpopulation.
